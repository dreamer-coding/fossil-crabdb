# ***Blue Crab Database by Fossil Logic***

CrabDB is a lightweight, portable key-value database designed to offer fast and efficient data storage in a user-friendly format. Available in two distinct interfaces—**MyShell** and **NoShell**—CrabDB tailors its experience to fit various use cases, from those who prefer a SQL-like syntax to those who prefer raw, key-based access. Its book-inspired structure, where each entry is akin to a page in a book, makes managing key-value pairs intuitive and easy to understand, while ensuring high performance across both small and large datasets.

## Prerequisites

To get started with Fossil CrabDB, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: If you don’t have Meson installed, follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).

### Adding Fossil CrabDB Dependency

#### Adding Fossil CrabDB Dependency With Meson

1. **Install Meson Build System**:
   Install Meson version `1.3` or newer:

   ```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # To install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # To upgrade Meson
   ```

2. **Create a `.wrap` File**:
   Add the `fossil-crabdb.wrap` file in your `subprojects` directory and include the following content:

   ```ini
   # ======================
   # Git Wrap package definition
   # ======================
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-crabdb.git
   revision = v0.2.3

   [provide]
   fossil-crabdb = fossil_crabdb_dep
   ```

3. **Integrate the Dependency**:
   In your `meson.build` file, integrate Fossil CrabDB by adding the following line:

   ```ini
   dep = dependency('fossil-crabdb')
   ```

---

## Configure Options

You have options when configuring the build, each serving a different purpose:

- **Running Tests**: To enable running tests, use `-Dwith_test=enabled` when configuring the build.

Example:

```sh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```
