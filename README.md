# ***Blue Crab Database System by Fossil Logic***

Blue CrabDB is a comprehensive, platform-independent data ecosystem crafted to streamline the management, storage, and intelligent processing of key-value pairs within namespaces. Developed in C and C++, it provides high performance and reliability across various operating systems. At its core is **CrabDB**, a powerful database engine, enhanced by **CrabQL**, a SQL-like query language designed for precise data retrieval and manipulation. The suite also includes **CrabSearch** for fast, relevant full-text search, and **CrabAI** for AI-driven analytics that yield predictive insights and smarter data handling. Additionally, **CrabLogs** offers robust logging for secure transaction tracking, while **CrabSync** ensures reliable synchronization across multiple instances, maintaining data consistency across environments. Altogether, Blue CrabDBâ€™s modules deliver a unified, advanced solution, making it ideal for applications requiring speed, reliability, and sophisticated data capabilities.

# Key Features

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensures consistent performance and functionality across Windows, macOS, Linux, and other major platforms, making it versatile for a wide range of applications.
2. **Modular Design**: Features a collection of powerful components, including **CrabDB**, **CrabQL**, **CrabSearch**, **CrabAI**, **CrabLogs**, **CrabSync**, and more. Each module can be easily integrated and customized to meet specific project needs, offering flexibility for different use cases.
3. **Efficient Build Systems**: Utilizes the Meson build system for C and C++ components, enabling fast build times and a user-friendly syntax that enhances the developer experience.
4. **High Performance**: Written in C and C++ for optimized performance and resource efficiency, making Blue CrabDB ideal for high-demand desktop and embedded applications.
5. **Extensive Documentation and Examples**: Accompanied by comprehensive documentation and sample code for each module, simplifying the development process and accelerating the onboarding of new users.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: This project relies on Meson. If you don't have Meson installed, visit the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html) for installation instructions.

## Adding Dependency

1. **Install Meson Build System**: Before integrating the dependency, ensure you have Meson `1.3` or newer installed on your host system. You can install it with this command:

   ```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # to install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # to upgrade Meson
   ```

2. **Adding Wrap File**: You can add a `.wrap`, first go into the `subprojects` directory and create `fossil-crabdb.wrap` then copy the definition into the file:

   ```ini
   # ======================
   # Git Wrap package definition
   # ======================
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-crabdb.git
   revision = v0.2.0

   [provide]
   fossil-crabdb = fossil_crabdb_dep
   ```

3. **Integrate the New Dependency**: After creating the dependency `.wrap` file, you need to integrate it into your Meson project. This typically involves adding the dependency to your `meson.build` file. Here's an example of how you might do that:

   ```ini
   dep = dependency('fossil-crabdb') # includes everything
   ```

   This line retrieves the `fossil-crabdb` dependency, allowing you to use it in your project.

## Configure Options

You have options when configuring the build, each serving a different purpose:

- **Running Tests**: To enable running tests, use `-Dwith_test=enabled` when configuring the build.

Example:

```sh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```
