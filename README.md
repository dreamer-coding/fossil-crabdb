# ***Blue Crab by Fossil Logic***

Blue Crab is a lightweight, portable key-value database built for speed, efficiency, and ease of use. It offers multiple interfaces to fit different workflows: **MyShell** for SQL-like commands, **NoShell** for direct key-value operations, **TimeShell** for timestamped time-series data, **CacheShell** for in-memory caching with TTL support, and **FileShell** for straightforward file management. Its book-inspired structure, where each entry resembles a page, makes organizing and accessing data intuitive, while maintaining high performance across both small and large datasets.

## ***Prerequisites***

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: If you don‚Äôt have Meson `1.8.0` or newer installed, follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).
- **Conan Package Manager**: If you prefer using Conan, ensure it is installed by following the instructions on the official [Conan website](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html).

### Adding Dependency

#### Adding via Meson Git Wrap

To add a git-wrap, place a `.wrap` file in `subprojects` with the Git repo URL and revision, then use `dependency('fossil-crabdb')` in `meson.build` so Meson can fetch and build it automatically.

#### Integrate the Dependency:

Add the `fossil-crabdb.wrap` file in your `subprojects` directory and include the following content:

```ini
[wrap-git]
url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-crabdb.git
revision = v0.2.4

[provide]
dependency_names = fossil-crabdb
```

**Note**: For the best experience, always use the latest releases. Visit the [releases](https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-crabdb/releases) page for the latest versions.

## Configure Options

You have options when configuring the build, each serving a different purpose:

- **Running Tests**: To enable running tests, use `-Dwith_test=enabled` when configuring the build.

Example:

```sh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```

### Tests Double as Samples

The project is designed so that **test cases serve two purposes**:

- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests** ‚Äì validate the framework‚Äôs correctness.  
- üìñ **Usage Samples** ‚Äì demonstrate how to use these libraries through test cases.  

This approach keeps the codebase compact and avoids redundant ‚Äúhello world‚Äù style examples.  
Instead, the same code that proves correctness also teaches usage.  

This mirrors the **Meson build system** itself, which tests its own functionality by using Meson to test Meson.  
In the same way, Fossil Logic validates itself by demonstrating real-world usage in its own tests via Fossil Test.  

```bash
meson test -C builddir -v
```

Running the test suite gives you both verification and practical examples you can learn from.
