# ***Blue CrabDB Database System by Fossil Logic***

Blue CrabDB is a comprehensive, platform-independent database system designed to streamline the management and storage of key-value pairs within namespaces. Written in C and C++, Blue CrabDB is built to offer high performance and reliability across various operating systems. The C and C++ components are built using the Meson build system, ensuring efficient development and deployment processes.

## Key Features

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensures consistent performance and functionality on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other platforms.
2. **Modular Design**: Offers a collection of modular components that can be easily integrated and customized to meet specific project requirements.
3. **Efficient Build Systems**: Utilizes Meson for C and C++ components, providing a modern build system known for its fast build times and user-friendly syntax.
4. **High Performance**: Written in C and C++ to provide optimal performance and resource efficiency, making it suitable for desktop and embedded applications.
5. **Extensive Documentation and Examples**: Comes with comprehensive documentation and sample code to aid developers in getting started quickly and effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: This project relies on Meson. If you don't have Meson installed, visit the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html) for installation instructions.

## Adding Dependency

1. **Install Meson Build System**: Before integrating the dependency, ensure you have Meson `1.3` or newer installed on your host system. You can install it with this command:

   ```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # to install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # to upgrade Meson
   ```

2. **Adding Wrap File**: You can add a `.wrap`, first go into the `subprojects` directory and create `fossil-crabdb.wrap` then copy the definition into the file:

   ```ini
   # ======================
   # Git Wrap package definition
   # ======================
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-crabdb.git
   revision = v0.1.3

   [provide]
   fossil-crabdb = fossil_crabdb_dep
   ```

3. **Integrate the New Dependency**: After creating the dependency `.wrap` file, you need to integrate it into your Meson project. This typically involves adding the dependency to your `meson.build` file. Here's an example of how you might do that:

   ```ini
   dep = dependency('fossil-crabdb') # includes everything
   ```

   This line retrieves the `fossil-crabdb` dependency, allowing you to use it in your project.

## Configure Options

You have options when configuring the build, each serving a different purpose:

- **Running Tests**: To enable running tests, use `-Dwith_test=enabled` when configuring the build.

Example:

```sh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```

## Usage Examples

### CrabQL SQL-like Commands

CrabQL provides SQL-like commands to interact with the Blue CrabDB database. Here are some examples of how to use these commands:

```sql
-- Insert a new key-value pair
INSERT INTO table_name (key, value) VALUES ('myKey', 'myValue');

-- Update an existing key-value pair
UPDATE table_name SET value = 'newValue' WHERE key = 'myKey';

-- Select a value by key
SELECT value FROM table_name WHERE key = 'myKey';

-- Delete a key-value pair
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE key = 'myKey';

-- List all key-value pairs
LIST;

-- Clear all key-value pairs
CLEAR;

-- Show the contents of the database
SHOW;

-- Drop the entire database
DROP;

-- Check if a key exists
EXIST ('myKey');

-- Search by key
SEARCH_KEY ('myKey');

-- Search by value
SEARCH_VALUE ('myValue');

-- Sort by key
SORT_BY_KEY;

-- Sort by value
SORT_BY_VALUE;
```

### CrabQL Script Syntax

CrabQL scripts are similar to Meson build files, using `#` for comments and single quotes for strings. Hereâ€™s an example script:

```ini
# This is a CrabQL script

# Insert commands
insert ('myKey1', 'myValue1');
insert ('myKey2', 'myValue2');

# Update command
update ('myKey1', 'updatedValue1');

# Select command
select ('myKey2');

# Delete command
delete ('myKey1');

# List all entries
list();

# Clear the database
clear();

# Show the current state of the database
show();

# Drop the database
drop();

# Check if a key exists
exist ('myKey2');

# Search for a value
search_value ('updatedValue1');

# Sort by key
sort_by_key();

# Sort by value
sort_by_value();
```
