# ***Blue Crab Database by Fossil Logic***

CrabDB is a lightweight, portable key-value database designed to offer fast and efficient data storage in a user-friendly format. Available in two distinct interfaces‚Äî**MyShell** and **NoShell**‚ÄîCrabDB tailors its experience to fit various use cases, from those who prefer a SQL-like syntax to those who prefer raw, key-based access. Its book-inspired structure, where each entry is akin to a page in a book, makes managing key-value pairs intuitive and easy to understand, while ensuring high performance across both small and large datasets.

## Prerequisites

To get started with Fossil CrabDB, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: If you don‚Äôt have Meson installed, follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).

### Adding Dependency

#### Adding via Meson Git Wrap

To add a git-wrap, place a `.wrap` file in `subprojects` with the Git repo URL and revision, then use `dependency('fossil-crabdb')` in `meson.build` so Meson can fetch and build it automatically.

#### Adding via Conan GitHub repository

 packages directly from a GitHub repository if it contains a valid `conanfile.py`.

```bash
conan install git+https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-crabdb.git#v0.2.4 --name fossil_crabdb --build=missing
```

#### Integrate the Dependency:

Add the `fossil-crabdb.wrap` file in your `subprojects` directory and include the following content:

```ini
[wrap-git]
url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-crabdb.git
revision = v0.2.4

[provide]
dependency_names = fossil-crabdb
```

**Note**: For the best experience, always use the latest releases. Visit the [releases](https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-crabdb/releases) page for the latest versions.

## Configure Options

You have options when configuring the build, each serving a different purpose:

- **Running Tests**: To enable running tests, use `-Dwith_test=enabled` when configuring the build.

Example:

```sh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```

### Tests Double as Samples

The project is designed so that **test cases serve two purposes**:

- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests** ‚Äì validate the framework‚Äôs correctness.  
- üìñ **Usage Samples** ‚Äì demonstrate how to use these libraries through test cases.  

This approach keeps the codebase compact and avoids redundant ‚Äúhello world‚Äù style examples.  
Instead, the same code that proves correctness also teaches usage.  

This mirrors the **Meson build system** itself, which tests its own functionality by using Meson to test Meson.  
In the same way, Fossil Logic validates itself by demonstrating real-world usage in its own tests via Fossil Test.  

```bash
meson test -C builddir -v
```

Running the test suite gives you both verification and practical examples you can learn from.
